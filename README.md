# [Algorithms, Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/home/info)

Programming assignments of Coursera's Algorithm course by Dr.Kevin Wayne and Dr.Robert Sedgewick.

This repo is for all the work done as a part of my Computer Science's education journey.

## About this Course
This course covers the essential information that every serious programmer needs to know about algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations. 

Part I covers elementary data structures, sorting, and searching algorithms. 

Part II focuses on graph- and string-processing algorithms.

All the features of this course are available for free.  It does not offer a certificate upon completion.
